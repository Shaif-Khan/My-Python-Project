🐍 Python Data Analysis & Machine Learning Projects
Pandas | Jupyter Notebook | Scikit-learn | Data Mining | EDA

Hello Connections! 👋
I'm Shaif Khan, a data analyst and backend developer with an MCA from Lalit Narayan Mishra Institute of Economic Development and Social Change, Patna, Bihar, affiliated to Aryabhatta Knowledge University, Patna, Bihar.

Here’s a collection of my Python-based projects, where I performed data cleaning, EDA, predictive modeling, and association rule mining — all using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for real-world business insights.

🧾 Project Highlights:

🏦 Loan Approval Prediction (ML Project)
      ✅ Cleaned and preprocessed loan application data
      
      ✅ Performed EDA: correlations, missing values, feature engineering
      
      ✅ Built and evaluated ML classification models to predict loan approval
      
      ✅ Tools used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn

🪔 Diwali Sales Data Analysis (Pandas Project)
      ✅ Loaded and cleaned retail data from Diwali season
      
      ✅ Performed sales trend analysis, customer behavior segmentation
      
      ✅ Delivered actionable marketing insights using Pandas + Visualization
      
      ✅ Designed in Jupyter Notebook with clean and visual output

📞 Customer Churn & Telecom EDA
      ✅ Performed detailed EDA on telecom customer data
      
      ✅ Analyzed churn patterns, customer retention KPIs
      
      ✅ Visualized findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn
      
      ✅ Preprocessed data for potential ML models

🛒 Market Basket Analysis (MBA)
      ✅ Implemented Apriori Algorithm using mlxtend
      
      ✅ Cleaned and reshaped retail transaction data for analysis
      
      ✅ Discovered frequent itemsets and generated association rules
      
      ✅ A great example of data mining and recommendation system foundations
